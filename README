This is a free tool provided for the Android mobile platform by Comwired.com to
assist in the crafting of DNS Queries and printing the results in a simple
form. We have the hope that by providing this application to the Open Source
community that it will be extended and used by the community.

If your just wanting the APK it can be found in /bin/DNSQuery.apk and should be
the latest build.

Everything should be included to be easily imported into the Eclipse IDE and
has been developed to build on the Android 1.5 platform.

Enjoy!

If you need any help or bugs please use github as your forum.
